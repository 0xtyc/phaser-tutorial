# phaser-tutorial

This repository is based on the [Phaser toturial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1). I went through the tutorial, add comments and restructured the code. 

## Usage 
Install the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) and start the webserver in this repo:
```
http-server
```
Install the dependency and build the game with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle the JS files.
```
npm install 
npm run build
```
The game should be ready in your localhost.
